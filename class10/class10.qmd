## 1. The PDB database

The mainn repository of biomolecular structure data is called the PDB found at: http://www.rcsb.org

Let's see what this database contains. I went to PDB > Analyze > PDB Statistics > By Exp method and molecular type.

```{r}
pdbstats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
pdbstats
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
pdbstats$X.ray
```
The comma in these numbers is causing them to be read as character rather than numeric. 

I can fix this by replacing "," for nothing "" with the `sub()` function:

```{r}
x <- pdbstats$X.ray
sum (as.numeric( sub(",", "", x) ))
```

Or I can use the **readr** package and the `read_csv()` function. 

```{r}
library(readr)
pdbstats2 <- read_csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
pdbstats2
```

I want to clean the column names so they are all lower case and don't have spaces in them
```{r}
colnames(pdbstats2)
```

```{r}
library(janitor)
df<- clean_names(pdbstats2)
df
```

Total number of X-ray structures
```{r}
sum(df$x_ray)
```

Total number of structures
```{r}
sum(df$total)
```

Percentage of X-ray structures
```{r}
sum(df$x_ray)/sum(df$total) *100
```

Percentage of EM structures
```{r}
sum(df$em)/sum(df$total)  *100
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
tot.prot <- df[1,]$total
tot.prot/sum(df$total)
```



## 2. Using Mol*

The main Mol* homepage at: https://molstar.org/viewer 
We can input our own PDB files or just give it a PDB database accession code (4 letter PDB code).

## 3. Introduction to Bio3D in R

We can use the **bio3d** package for structural bioinformatics to read PDB data into R

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

> Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object?

There are 198 amino acid residues

```{r}
length( pdbseq(pdb) )
```

>Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues?

MK1

>Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure?

2 chains: A and B


Looking at the `pdb` object in more detail

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```


```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

Let's try a new function not yet in the bio3d package. It requires the **r3dmol** package that we need to install with `install.packages("r3dmol")` and `install.packages("shiny")`

```{r}
source("https://tinyurl.com/viewpdb")
#view.pdb(pdb, backgroundColor="pink")
```

## 4. Predicting functional dynamics

We can use the `nma()` function in bio3d to predict the large-scale functional motions of biomolecules. 

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

Write out a trajectory of the predicted molecular motion:
```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```
